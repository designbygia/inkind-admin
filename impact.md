Community Education Partnerships' mission is to increase the learning opportunities and enhance the academic achievement of students experiencing homelessness and housing insecurity. Community Education Partnerships offers its students: individualized tutoring and mentoring, backpacks, school supplies, books, learning resources, enrollment assistance, and opportunities to participate in extracurricular enrichment activities.

This app tracks volunteer and student data, and feedback from the mentoring sessions that are a core part of CEP's programming. These sessions provide vital stability to young people who lack access to learning opportunities and face a multitude of challenges that affect their educational outcomes. CEP volunteers form lasting relationships with students, and communicate their needs of food insecurity and other necessities to CEP, ensuring that staff members are able to facilitate the appropriate support for students, and by extension, their families. This app will enable CEP to collect and analyze critical data, facilitate quicker response times to requests for support, and enable them to apply for grant funding, ensuring that their work remains sustainable.
